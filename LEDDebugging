Sometimes when soldering LEDs they some of them don't work.
There can be a few causes of this.

1. LED soldered in the wrong direction (polarity)
2. Bad LED
3. Damaged trace on the pcb (disconnect/short)
4. Stray solder causing a short

# Debugging LEDs

Using the internal CLI it is possible to debug which LED(s) are not working.
This is particularily important when checking whether the LEDs were soldered in the correct direction.

1. Access CLI (TODO - Add link)
2. Enable pixel test rotation mode
```
pixelTest r
```
3. If necessary slow the frame speed (1-255, higher number translates to a larger divider, slowing the frames down)
```
ledFPS 100
```
4. Check to make sure each LED turns on in order, starting from the top left going to the right, then wrapping to the next line.
5. If any LEDs do not turn on or turn on unexpectedly, it is soldered in the wrong direction
